Welcome to our workshop!

Presumably we'll have more to say, eventually.

For now, enjoy these pictures...

## Trees Through Time

Have you ever thought about how phylogenies and our depictions of them have evolved?

_Genealogical Tree of Dead and Living Languages, by Félix Gallet (c. 1800)_

Look at that! A phylogeny of languages, more than 50 years before Darwin will publish the Origin of Species!

_'Paleontology' foldout-chart, from Hitchcock 1840_

Another pre-Darwinian phylogeny, this time actually of organisms.

_Haeckel, 1905, The Evolution of Man_

Okay, that's enough from Ernst Haeckel for now...

What is it about paleontology and combining spindle diagrams with trees?

## The Power of Trees

Trees are really useful!

Huang et al., 2015, PNAS, Fig 1D: This figure shows the effect of ancestor-descendant relationships on the measuring of phylogenetic diversity and the impact of extinction.

Are you excited yet?
