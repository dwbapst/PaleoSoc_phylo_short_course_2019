Attendees are asked to read over the following four readings, at their discretion, before the workshop. The following list is rank-ordered; if you only read one, read the first, but if you read two, read the first two. The first two (Wright, 2017; Wright, 2019) in particular are important and comprehensive reviews of concepts specifically tied to the topics of this short course: respectively, morphological Bayesian phylogenetics and use of the fossilized birth-death-sampling model in inferring phylogenetic trees. Holder & Lewis covers the basics of Bayesian phylogenetics, while Nee covers what birth-death models are, and covers their history of use in paleontology and systematics.

During the workshop, we will be mostly discussing applying analyses to a dataset taken from Smith & Zamora's 2009 study of early Paleozoic cinctan echinoderms. Reading their study is encouraged but will likely be less useful than reading the four papers above.

We may post a list of additional readings here that we think you will find useful later, after the workshop! (If we remember to update this...)
