title: "Recommended Readings"

---

Attendees are asked to read over the following four readings, at their discretion, before the workshop. The following list is rank-ordered; if you only read one, read the first, but if you read two, read the first two. The first two (Wright, 2017; Wright, 2019) in particular are important and comprehensive reviews of concepts specifically tied to the topics of this short course: respectively, morphological Bayesian phylogenetics and use of the fossilized birth-death-sampling model in inferring phylogenetic trees. Holder & Lewis covers the basics of Bayesian phylogenetics, while Nee covers what birth-death models are, and covers their history of use in paleontology and systematics.

### About Our Dataset
    
During the workshop, we will be mostly discussing applying analyses to a dataset taken from Smith & Zamora's 2009 study of early Paleozoic cinctan echinoderms. Reading their study is encouraged but will likely be less useful than reading the four papers above.

### Additional Resources

The popular regular webinar series, [PhyloSeminar](http://phyloseminar.org/) recently hosted a four-part series by Paul Lewis that act as a good primer to the basics of phylogenetics (Part 1), the basics of tree likelihood (Part 2), and the basics of MCMC-based Bayesian phylogenetics (parts 3a & 3b), and we recommend these to participants who want more detailed background on phylogenetics work. The recorded lectures are on Youtube, and the slides for each part are also available:

- Part 1 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r4z0YJq580), [slides](https://git.io/vpIW9))

- Part 2 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsLeY0wZr4Y), [slides](https://git.io/vpbvn))

- Part 3a ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PWlnNsfz90), [slides](https://git.io/fc8pC))

- Part 3b ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLtOS--YwkU), [slides](https://git.io/f4dZh))
