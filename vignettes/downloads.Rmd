### Original Data Set:

- [Smith & Zamora matrix + subsequently added species](data_for_downloads/Cincta_Smith_&_Zamora_2009.nex)

### Data Formatted for RevBayes:

- [Cinctans_for_RevBayes.nex](data_for_downloads/Cinctans.nex)

### Chronostratigraphic Data formatted for RevBayes:

  *(Note: In this file, taxa are listed as point-occurrences at their first-appearance times, and all are shifted so the youngest FAD is at 0 time-units.)*

- [cincta_fossil_intervals_FA.tsv](data_for_downloads/cincta_fossil_intervals_FA.tsv)

### Eucladida Data set for PCM Module (.RData file):

- [Eucladida_Inputs.RData](data_for_downloads/Eucladida_Inputs.RData)
