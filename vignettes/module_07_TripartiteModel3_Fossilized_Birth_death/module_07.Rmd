#### Lecture & Hands-On with RevBayes/RevNotebook


If students come away with anything from my FBD lecture, it should be
that FBD is a simple, but sensible model of diversification and
sampling, which allows us to relate how well sampled a given fossil
record is to inform how much evolutionary history we may have
ultimately missed, and thus when clades may have diverged in the
shadow before time.

## Pure Birth Models

Simulate under a pure-birth process and ask whose data looks like this? 


Nee 2006

## Birth-Death Models

Simulate under a birth-death process and ask whose data looks like this? 

### How We've Used Birth-Death In Paleontology

something something Foote, per-capita rates



As a note, I do plan on saying that lambda, mu and psi are often given the alternative notation of p/q/r in some paleontological studies -- and then saying nothing more at all.

## Fossilized Birth-Death Model

-Simulate under the FBD and show that this process allows sampled ancestors? 	
	

### Serial Sampling

### Sampled Ancestors

### FBD Ranges Model

# Bringing It All Together

## How long will it run?

A long time.

## Post-Analysis Examination

The MCMC is done. That was the easy part, now its the hard part.

Thinking about the output of Bayesian analyses isn't easy...

Thinking about the output of Phylogenetic  analyses isn't easy...

Thankfully these two problems somewhat solve each other.

### Did it converge?

Tracer

### What did the posterior find?

More Tracer

### Summarizing the tree(s)

> A single tree is not worth the forest.

	- From Pete:
		- BD & FBD (BDS) models for putting prior probabilities on tree topologies offer independent check on characters 
		- A. Emphasis: Probabilities getting fossil record given phylogeny based on likelihood of unsampled ancestors AND probability of no sampled sister taxa (aka, Raupâ€™s Revenge).
		- B. Our old friend hyperpriors used to create distributions for these rates.
