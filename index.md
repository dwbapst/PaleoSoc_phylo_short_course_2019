The 2019 Paleontological Society Short Course, ***Quantitative Methods in Phylogenetic Paleobiology***, will beheld on conjunction with the 2019 Geological Society of American Annual Meeting in Phoenix, Arizona. This short course is organized by Sandra Carlson, Peter Wagner, April Wright, Laura Soul, David Wright, David Bapst, and Rachel Warnock. 

In the past decade, there has been considerable of Bayesian methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships, involving probabilistic models of phenotypic character evolution, and new 'tip-dating' approaches for inferring dated phylogenies containing fossils as operational tip taxa, particularly those that use a method that accounts for the incomplete sampling of the fossil record, known as the *Fossilized Birth-Death Model*. The 2019 Paleontological Society Short Course will be a day-long workshop-style short course that will feature not just lectures about methodological advances, but also hands-on exercises for the audience members to perform on their laptop computers.

## When and Where

As usual for Paleontological Short Courses, our workshop will be held on the preceding Saturday, August 21st, before oral and poster sessions begin at GSA. The short course will run from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (local Arizona time), in the ‘Valley of the Sun’ ballroom at the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown Hotel. This hotel is two blocks from the Phoenix Convention Center, located here:

A short workshop for installing relevant software will be held Friday evening, with the exact times and location to be announced.  

We emphasize that because this short course is being conducted as a workshop rather than a day-long symposium, attendees will get the most out of the course by attending the entire session.   

## If You Want to Attend...

The Short Course is sponsored and supported by The Paleontological Society, and is open to all interested parties. Participation is entirely free-of-charge. Furthermore, it is *not* necessary to register for the GSA annual meeting, in order to attend and participate with the Short Course. In order to best prepare for the short course,

We do request that all of those who plan on attending to register via the Google Form, if they have not done so, even on the day of the workshop itself. We will be able to best aim our instruction if we have accurate information on the background and interests of our participants.
