abstract ={Lateral gene transfer (LGT), the acquisition of genes from other species, is a major evolutionary force. However, its success as an adaptive process makes the reconstruction of the history of life an intricate puzzle: If no gene has remained unaffected during the course of life's evolution, how can one rely on molecular markers to reconstruct the relationships among species? Here, we take a completely different look at LGT and its impact for the reconstruction of the history of life. Rather than trying to remove the effect of LGT in phylogenies, and ignoring as a result most of the information of gene histories, we use an explicit phylogenetic model of gene transfer to reconcile gene histories with the tree of species. We studied 16 bacterial and archaeal phyla, representing a dataset of 12,000 gene families distributed in 336 genomes. Our results show that, in most phyla, LGT provides an abundant phylogenetic signal on the pattern of species diversification and that this signal is robust to the choice of gene families under study. We also find that LGT brings an abundant signal on the location of the root of species trees, which has been previously overlooked. Our results quantify the great variety of gene transfer rates among lineages of the tree of life and provide strong support for the `complexity hypothesis,' which states that genes whose products participate to macromolecular protein complexes are relatively resistant to transfer.},

In constructing such intervals for parameters in discrete distributions, less conservative behavior results from inverting a single two-sided test than inverting two separate one-sided tests of half the nominal level each. We illustrate for a variety of discrete problems, including interval estimation of a binomial parameter, the difference and the ratio of two binomial parameters for independent samples, and the odds ratio.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling has become increasingly popular in phylogenetics as a method for both estimating the maximum likelihood topology and for assessing nodal confidence. Despite the growing use of posterior probabilities, the relationship between the Bayesian measure of confidence and the most commonly used confidence measure in phylogenetics, the nonparametric bootstrap proportion, is poorly understood. We used computer simulation to investigate the behavior of three phylogenetic confidence methods: Bayesian posterior probabilities calculated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC-PP), maximum likelihood bootstrap proportion (ML-BP), and maximum parsimony bootstrap proportion (MP-BP). We simulated the evolution of DNA sequence on 17-taxon topologies under 18 evolutionary scenarios and examined the performance of these methods in assigning confidence to correct monophyletic and incorrect monophyletic groups, and we examined the effects of increasing character number on support value. BMCMC-PP and ML-BP were often strongly correlated with one another but could provide substantially different estimates of support on short internodes. In contrast, BMCMC-PP correlated poorly with MP-BP across most of the simulation conditions that we examined. For a given threshold value, more correct monophyletic groups were supported by BMCMC-PP than by either ML-BP or MP-BP. When threshold values were chosen that fixed the rate of accepting incorrect monophyletic relationship as true at 5%, all three methods recovered most of the correct relationships on the simulated topologies, although BMCMC-PP and ML-BP performed better than MP-BP. BMCMC-PP was usually a less biased predictor of phylogenetic accuracy than either bootstrapping method. BMCMC-PP provided high support values for correct topological bipartitions with fewer characters than was needed for nonparametric bootstrap.},

  Abstract                 = {A procedure of combining trees obtained from data sets of different kinds, similar to Brooks's technique but for a different purpose, with the aim of combining these data sets, is detailed along with examples used in five unrepeated combinations from a total of 15 published datasets. The procedure does not adjoin raw data sets, but instead combines the binary-coded factors of the trees, each tree from a different data set, together. This allows the combining of data that are only available as pair-wise distances with data obtained directly from characters of the organisms. It economizes the analysis of combined nucleotide sequence data which can be very large, and preserves information for each kind of data in the combination. The procedure allows for missing data as well, and can be regarded as a new consensus method -- mathematical properties have yet to be investigated. The desirability of combining gene trees, obtained from molecular data, to enable the inference of species trees is discussed in light of using this procedure.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for the estimation of migration rates and effective population sizes is described. It uses a maximum-likelihood framework based on coalescence theory. The parameters are estimated by Metropolis-Hastings importance sampling. In a two-population model this method estimates four parameters: the effective population size and the immigration rate for each population relative to the mutation rate. Summarizing over loci can be done by assuming either that the mutation rate is the same for all loci or that the mutation rates are gamma distributed among loci but the same for all sites of a locus. The estimates are as good as or better than those from an optimized FST-based measure. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/lamarc.html.},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have provided a Bayesian inference machine in image analysis and in other areas of spatial statistics for several years, founded on the pioneering ideas of Ulf Grenander. More recently, the observation that hyperparameters can be included as part of the updating schedule and the fact that almost any multivariate distribution is equivalently a Markov random field has opened the way to the use of MCMC in general Bayesian computation. In this paper, we trace the early development of MCMC in Bayesian inference, review some recent computational progress in statistical physics, based on the introduction of auxiliary variables, and discuss its current and future relevance in Bayesian applications. We briefly describe a simple MCMC implementation for the Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments, with which we have some practical experience.},

  Abstract                 = {Variations of nucleotidic composition affect phylogenetic inference conducted under stationary models of evolution. In particular, they may cause unrelated taxa sharing similar base composition to be grouped together in the resulting phylogeny. To address this problem, we developed a nonstationary and nonhomogeneous model accounting for compositional biases. Unlike previous nonstationary models, which are branchwise, that is, assume that base composition only changes at the nodes of the tree, in our model, the process of compositional drift is totally uncoupled from the speciation events. In addition, the total number of events of compositional drift distributed across the tree is directly inferred from the data. We implemented the method in a Bayesian framework, relying on Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, and applied it to several nucleotidic data sets. In most cases, the stationarity assumption was rejected in favor of our nonstationary model. In addition, we show that our method is able to resolve a well-known artifact. By Bayes factor evaluation, we compared our model with 2 previously developed nonstationary models. We show that the coupling between speciations and compositional shifts inherent to branchwise models may lead to an overparameterization, resulting in a lesser fit. In some cases, this leads to incorrect conclusions, concerning the nature of the compositional biases. In contrast, our compound model more flexibly adapts its effective number of parameters to the data sets under investigation. Altogether, our results show that accounting for nonstationary sequence evolution may require more elaborate and more flexible models than those currently used.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantitative solution for Hennig's parasitological method is presented. Cladograms summarizing natural relationships among parasite taxa are converted into host-group characters by means of additive binary coding. Unrooted Wagner analysis followed by most parsimonious rooting produces a maximum information-content, representation of natural host-parasite relationships. Because host-parasite relationships result either from random colonization or from co-speciation, host relationships well corroborated by a multi-parasite analysis correspond to.host phylogeny. Poorly corroborated, host relationships indicate an ambiguous parasite message alerting a worker to possible host transfers. Thus, such analyses point out co-speciation and random colonization components of host-parasite systems. Single or multiple parasite taxa may be used. A host phylogeny based on non-parasite characters is neither necessary nor sufficient for studying phylogenetic aspects of coevolution, although such may be helpful in testing ambiguous aspects. Once a host-group cladogram based on .parasites has been established, phylogenetic interpretations for each observed host-parasite relationship may be made according to a listed set of necessary and sufficient criteria. Finally, evaluation of two models of coevolution, a "vicariance" model and the "resource-tracking" model, indicates that the latter cannot be extrapolated successfully to explain congruent phylogenetic differentiation of hosts and parasites and that the former model represents the general pattern of natural relationships among hosts and parasites.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is described for reconstructing presumed cladistic evolutionary sequences of recent organisms and its implications are discussed. Characters of the organisms to be studied are presented in a data matrix of the type employed in numerical taxonomy with the character states arrayed according to a presumed evolutionary sequence. The reconstruction proceeds on the hypothesis that the minimum number of evolutionary steps yields the correct cladogram. The method has been programmed for computer processing.},

  Abstract                 = {An attempt has been made to establish a procedure for estimating the course taken by evolution. The model used is that of a branching random walk, which is strictly valid only when the causes of divergence between populations are random genetic drift and variable selection. With suitable transformations of the data, evolution can then be considered as a branching Brownian-motion process. To keep the model as simple as possible it was supposed that no population becomes extinct and that each population splits, at a random time, into two daughter populations each identical to its parent. The problem was to estimate the form and dimensions of the most probable tree uniting the presently living populations. The ideal method of estimation, maximum likelihood, proved difficult and had to be replaced in part by alternative procedures. In addition to describing the available procedures in detail, a simple example is worked out fully, and the logical content and limitations of the methods are considered in depth.},

  Abstract                 = {A critical issue for users of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13 convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parametrizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},

Historically, the nonparametric bootstrap procedure has been the most frequently used method for assessing the support for specific phylogenetic relationships. The recent employment of Bayesian methods for phylogenetic inference problems has resulted in clade support being expressed in terms of posterior probabilities. We used simulated data and the four-taxon case to explore the relationship between nonparametric bootstrap values (as inferred by maximum likelihood) and posterior probabilities (as inferred by Bayesian analysis). The results suggest a complex association between the two measures. Three general regions of tree space can be identified: (1) the neutral zone, where differences between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values are not significant, (2) near the two-branch corner, and (3) deep in the two-branch corner. In the last two regions, significant differences occur between mean bootstrap and mean posterior probability values. Whether bootstrap or posterior probability values are higher depends on the data in support of alternative topologies. Examination of star topologies revealed that both bootstrap and posterior probability values differ significantly from theoretical expectations; in particular, there are more posterior probability values in the range 0.85???1 than expected by theory. Therefore, our results corroborate the findings of others that posterior probability values are excessively high. Our results also suggest that extrapolations from single topology branch-length studies are unlikely to provide any general conclusions regarding the relationship between bootstrap and posterior probability values.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular sequences obtained at different sampling times from populations of rapidly evolving pathogens and from ancient subfossil and fossil sources are increasingly available with modern sequencing technology. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical inference approach to the joint estimation of mutation rate and population size that incorporates the uncertainty in the genealogy of such temporally spaced sequences by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The Kingman coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population. We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters. We illustrate some of the important features of this approach on a genealogy of HIV-1 envelope (env) partial sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Principles abstracted from Hennig (1966) are used as axioms to form a quantitative analog of phylogenetic systematics. A close connection is demonstrated between phylogenetics and most parsimonious trees. The compatibility of some existing clustering methods with the principles is discussed. and a new clustering technique, the Weighted Invariant Step Strategy (WISS) is described. Generalization of the axioms to the case where direction of evolution is not assumed is examined, and it is shown that the Wagner Method for estimating evolutionary trees is consistent with the generalized phylogenetic axioms.},

  Abstract                 = {The logic of inferring phylogenies from measures of the phenotypic distance between species is examined, and a statistical model constructed. Criticisms which have been levelled by Farris (1981) against methods of inferring phylogenies from distances are dependent on one particular interpretation of the entity being inferred. If we take the branch lengths on the tree to be expected distances rather than path lengths, the major criticisms of these methods lose their force. Under the expected distance view, there is no reason to abandon distance measures solely because they fail to satisfy the triangle inequality. The expected distance interpretation fits naturally into a statistical inference framework for inferring phylogenies. This in turn provides justification for some of the most widely-used criteria of goodness of fit between a tree and the observed distances. However, the statistical framework does emphasize the weakness of distance methods if the assumptions of additivity of distances among the tree and of independence of the measurement errors of the distances are not met. The possible failure of additivity and of independence seem to be the most serious problems with using distance methods. These assumptions are dubious for many kinds of data often analyzed by distance methods. The assumption of a molecular clock affects the details of the computations, but can be fit into the statistical framework without difficulty. Given the validity of the additivity and independence assumptions, a statistical test of the clock could be performed.},

The trees are assumed to be rooted, with labelled tips but unlabelled root and unlabelled interior nodes. The method allows multifurcations as well as bifurcations. It makes use of a simple recurrence relation for T(n,m), the number of trees with n labelled tips and m unlabelled interior nodes. A table of the total number of trees is presented up to n = 22. There are 282,137,824 different trees having 10 tip species, and over 8.87 x 10<sup>23</sup> different trees having 20 tip species. The method is extended to count trees some of whose interior nodes may be labelled. The principal uses of these numbers will be to double-check algorithms and notation systems, and to frighten taxonomists.},

In particular, the relevance of the approaches to calculating Bayesian posterior densities for a variety of structured models will be discussed and illustrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a general method for the simulation of stochastic processes having probability densities known up to a constant of proportionality. Despite recent advances in its theory, the practice has remained controversial. This article makes the case for basing all inference on one long run of the Markov chain and estimating the Monte Carlo error by standard nonparametric methods well-known in the time-series and operations research literature. In passing it touches on the Kipnis-Varadhan central limit theorem for reversible Markov chains, on some new variance estimators, on judging the relative efficiency of competing Monte Carlo schemes, on methods for constructing more rapidly mixing Markov chains and on diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of the model space explored in statistical phylogenetics, emphasizing the need for new approaches to statistical model representation and software development. Clear communication and representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (i) reproducibility of an analysis, (ii) model development, and (iii) software design. Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the barrier for beginners and nonspecialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies. Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in the statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the large body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard components in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis?Hastings or Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution.

  Abstract                 = {The birth-death process is widely used in phylogenetics to model speciation and extinction. Recent studies have shown that the inferred rates are sensitive to assumptions about the sampling probability of lineages. Here, we examine the effect of the method used to sample lineages. Whereas previous studies have assumed random sampling, we consider two extreme cases of biased sampling: ???diversified sampling???, where tips are selected to maximize diversity, and ???cluster sampling???, where sample diversity is minimized. Diversified sampling appears to be standard practice, e.g., in analyses of higher taxa, while cluster sampling may occur under special circumstances, e.g., in studies of geographically defined floras or faunas. Using both simulations and analyses of empirical data, we show that inferred rates may be heavily biased if the sampling strategy is not modeled correctly. In particular, when a diversified sample is treated as if it were a random or complete sample, the extinction rate is severely underestimated, often close to 0. Such dramatic errors may lead to serious consequences, e.g. if estimated rates are used in assessing the vulnerability of threatened species to extinction. Using Bayesian model testing across 18 empirical data sets, we show that diversified sampling is commonly a better fit to the data than complete, random or cluster sampling. Inappropriate modeling of the sampling method may at least partly explain anomalous results that have previously been attributed to variation over time in birth and death rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenies that are reconstructed without fossil material often contain approximate dates for lineage splitting. For example, particular nodes on molecular phylogenies may be dated by known geographic events that caused lineages to split, thereby calibrating a molecular clock that is used to date other nodes. On the one hand, such phylogenies contain no information about lineages that have become extinct. On the other hand, they do provide a potentially useful testing ground for ideas about evolutionary processes. Here we first ask what such reconstructed phylogenies should be expected to look like under a birth-death process in which the birth and death parameters of lineages remain constant through time. We show that it is possible to estimate both the birth and death rates of lineages from the reconstructed phylogenies, even though they contain no explicit information about extinct lineages. We also show how such phylogenies can reveal mass extinctions and how their characteristic footprint can be distinguished from similar ones produced by density-dependent cladogenesis.},

(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Most methods for detecting Darwinian natural selection at the molecular level rely on estimating the rates or numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes in an alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences. In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous rate of substitution is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection. However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across the sequence. One widely used solution is to model variation in the nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture of several discrete or continuous probability distributions. Unfortunately, there is little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate probability distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. Here, we describe an approach to modeling variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution by using a Dirichlet process mixture model. The Dirichlet process allows there to be a countably infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very flexible in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. We implemented the model in a fully Bayesian approach, with all parameters of the model considered as random variables.},

  Abstract                 = {What does the posterior probability of a phylogenetic tree mean? This simulation study shows that Bayesian posterior probabilities have the meaning that is typically ascribed to them; the posterior probability of a tree is the probability that the tree is correct, assuming that the model is correct. At the same time, the Bayesian method can be sensitive to model misspecification, and the sensitivity of the Bayesian method appears to be greater than the sensitivity of the nonparametric bootstrap method (using maximum likelihood to estimate trees). Although the estimates of phylogeny obtained by use of the method of maximum likelihood or the Bayesian method are likely to be similar, the assessment of the uncertainty of inferred trees via either bootstrapping (for maximum likelihood estimates) or posterior probabilities (for Bayesian estimates) is not likely to be the same. We suggest that the Bayesian method be implemented with the most complex models of those currently available, as this should reduce the chance that the method will concentrate too much probability on too few trees.},

We use probabilistic substitution models specific to evolution in base paired regions of RNA. A number of these models have been implemented in a new phylogenetic inference software package for carrying out maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inferences. We describe our Bayesian phylogenetic method which uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to provide samples from the posterior distribution of tree topologies. Our results show support for four primary mammalian clades, in agreement with recent studies of much larger data sets mainly comprising nuclear DNA. We discuss some issues arising when using Bayesian techniques on RNA sequence data.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of population growth was pointed out by W. Feller [1] in 1939. He considered among other examples the "birth-and-death" process in which the expected birth and death rates (per head of population per unit of time) were constants, bo and do, say. In this paper, I shall give the complete solution of the equations governing the generalised birth-and-death process in which the birth and death rates b(t) and d(t) may be any specified functions of the time. The mathematical method employed starts from M. S. Bartlett's idea of replacing the differential-difference equations for the distribution of the population size by a partial differential equation for its generating function. For an account of this technique,1 reference may be made to Bartlett's North Carolina lectures [2]. The formulae obtained lead to an expression for the probability of the ultimate extinction of the population, and to the necessary and sufficient condition for a birth-and-death process to be of "transient" type. For transient processes the distribution of the cumulative population is also considered, but here in general it is not found possible to do more than evaluate its mean and variance as functions of t, although a complete solution (including the determination of the asymptotic form of the distribution as t tends to infinity) is obtained for the simple process in which the birth and death rates are independent of the time. It is shown that a birth-and-death process can be constructed to give an expected population size $\bar n_t$ which is any desired function of the time t, and among the many possible solutions the unique one is determined which makes the fluctuation, Var(nt), a minimum for all. The general theory is illustrated with reference of two examples. The first of these is the (b0, d1t) process introduced by N. Arley [3] in his study of the cascade showers associated with cosmic radiation; here the birth rate is constant and the death rate is a constant multiple of the "age, t, of the process. The $\bar n_t$ -curve is then Gaussian in form, and the process is always of transient type. The second example is provided by the family of "periodic" processes, in which the birth and death rates are periodic functions of the time t. These appear well adapted to describe the response of population growth (or epidemic spread) to the influence of the seasons.},

  Abstract                 = {Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of many variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions factor as a product of ldquo;local rdquo; functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative ldquo;turbo rdquo; decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms},

It can perform either maximum-likelihood or Bayesian analysis, and accomodates nucleotide sequence, SNP, microsatellite or elecrophoretic data, with resolved or unresolved haplotypes. It is available as portable source code and executables for all three major platforms.

We used simulated DNA data to assess accuracy of means and support or credibility intervals. In all cases the two methods had very similar results. Some parameter combinations led to overly narrow support or credibility intervals, excluding the truth more often than the desired percentage, for both methods. However, the Bayesian approach rejected the generative parameter values significantly less often than the likelihood approach, both in cases where the level of rejection was normal and in cases where it was too high.},

Introduction into their Local and Global tree proposal operators. They use the canonical representation of the tree and change few or all node heights.
This leads to topology changes which are reconstructed regarding the representation.

In their experience one algorithm can not be sufficient for good mixing.

They discuss the use of Bayesian MCMC and Maximum Likelihood and Bootstrapping approaches.

Their algorithms are available in BAMBE (Bayesian Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution)},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a Bayesian method based on Markov chain simulation to study the phylogenetic relationship in a group of DNA sequences. Under simple models of mutational events, our method produces a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the conditional distribution of the phylogeny given the observed sequences. Our algorithm strikes a reasonable balance between the desire to move globally through the space of phylogenies and the need to make computationally feasible moves in areas of high probability. Because phylogenetic information is described by a tree, we have created new diagnostics to handle this type of data structure. An important byproduct of the Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogeny building technique is that it provides estimates and corresponding measures of variability for any aspect of the phylogeny under study.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation ? extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0110268.e001" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Importantly, our survey spans recent policy initiatives and infrastructural changes; our analyses indicate that the positive impact of these community initiatives has been both dramatic and immediate. Although the results of our study indicate that the situation is dire, our findings also reveal tremendous recent progress in the sharing and preservation of phylogenetic data.</p>},

A transformation of the tree into a canonical cophenetic matrix form, with distinct entries along its superdiagonal, suggests a simple proposal distribution for selecting candidate trees "close" to the current tree in the chain. We apply the consequent Metropolis algorithm to published restriction site data on nine species of plants. The Markov chain mixes well from random starting trees, generating reproducible estimates and confidence sets for the path of evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms play a critical role in the Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference. We present a theoretical analysis of the rate of convergence of many of the widely used Markov chains. For N characters generated from a uniform mixture of two trees, we prove that the Markov chains take an exponentially long (in N) number of iterations to converge to the posterior distribution. Nevertheless, the likelihood plots for sample runs of the Markov chains deceivingly suggest that the chains converge rapidly to a unique tree. Our results rely on novel mathematical understanding of the log-likelihood function on the space of phylogenetic trees. The practical implications of our work are that Bayesian MCMC methods can be misleading when the data are generated from a mixture of trees. Thus, in cases of data containing potentially conflicting phylogenetic signals, phylogenetic reconstruction should be performed separately on each signal.},

  Abstract                 = {The sampling method proposed by Metropolis et al. (1953) requires the simulation of a Markov chain with a specified {pi} as its stationary distribution. Hastings (1970) outlined a general procedure for constructing and simulating such a Markov chain. The matrix P of transition probabilities is constructed using a defined symmetric function sij and an arbitrary transition matrix Q. Here, for a given Q, the relative merits of the two simple choices for sij suggested by Hastings (1970) are discussed. The optimum choice for sij is shown to be one of these. For the other choice, those Q are given which are known to make the sampling method based on P asymptotically less precise than independent sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Seq-Gen is a program that will simulate the evolution of nucleotide sequences along a phylogeny, using common models of the substitution process. A range of models of molecular evolution are implemented, including the general reversible model. Nucleotide frequencies and other parameters of the model may be given and site-specific rate heterogeneity can also be incorporated in a number of ways. Any number of trees may be read in and the program will produce any number of data sets for each tree. Thus, large sets of replicate simulations can be easily created. This can be used to test phylogenetic hypotheses using the parametric bootstrap. Availability: Seq-Gen can be obtained by WWW from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Seq-Gen/seq-gen.html or by FTP from ftp://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/packages/Seq-Gen/. The package includes the source code, manual and example files. An Apple Macintosh version is available from the same sites.},

  Abstract                 = {Birth-Death (Bi-De) is an application for the Apple Macintosh which simulates the growth of phylogenetic trees using various models of lineage birth and death. The trees produced are intended to be analogous to those reconstructed from molecular sequence data. The user may define a constant birth rate and death rate or a function describing how these rates vary by time or population size. Instantaneous mass extinctions can also be simulated. The package allows the tree produced to be used as a template for the simulated evolution of molecular sequence data under a range of different transition models.},

  Abstract                 = {We extend our recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian estimation of species divergence times to allow variable evolutionary rates among lineages. The method can use heterogeneous data from multiple gene loci and accommodate multiple fossil calibrations. Uncertainties in fossil calibrations are described using flexible statistical distributions. The prior for divergence times for nodes lacking fossil calibrations is specified by use of a birth-death process with species sampling. The prior for lineage-specific substitution rates is specified using either a model with autocorrelated rates among adjacent lineages (based on a geometric Brownian motion model of rate drift) or a model with independent rates among lineages specified by a log-normal probability distribution. We develop an infinite-sites theory, which predicts that when the amount of sequence data approaches infinity, the width of the posterior credibility interval and the posterior mean of divergence times form a perfect linear relationship, with the slope indicating uncertainties in time estimates that cannot be reduced by sequence data alone. Simulations are used to study the influence of among-lineage rate variation and the number of loci sampled on the uncertainty of divergence time estimates. The analysis suggests that posterior time estimates typically involve considerable uncertainties even with an infinite amount of sequence data, and that the reliability and precision of fossil calibrations are critically important to divergence time estimation. We apply our new algorithms to two empirical data sets and compare the results with those obtained in previous Bayesian and likelihood analyses. The results demonstrate the utility of our new algorithms.},

Standard MCMC convergence diagnostics would detect the problem in real data, and correction of the model misspecification would solve it.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: Estimating divergence times and rates of substitution from sequence data is plagued by the problem of rate variation between lineages. R8s version 1.5 is a program which uses parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric methods to relax the assumption of constant rates of evolution to obtain better estimates of rates and times. Unlike most programs for rate inference or phylogenetics, r8s permits users to convert results to absolute rates and ages by constraining one or more node times to be fixed, minimum or maximum ages (using fossil or other evidence). Version 1.5 uses truncated Newton nonlinear optimization code with bound constraints, offering superior performance over previous versions.Results: Availability: The linux executable, C source code, sample data sets and user manual are available free at http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s.Contact: mjsanderson@ucdavis.edu},

  Abstract                 = {Methods such as maximum parsimony (MP) are frequently criticized as being statistically unsound and not being based on any "model." On the other hand, advocates of MP claim that maximum likelihood (ML) has some fundamental problems. Here, we explore the connection between the different versions of MP and ML methods, particularly in light of recent theoretical results. We describe links between the two methods--for example, we describe how MP can be regarded as an ML method when there is no common mechanism between sites (such as might occur with morphological data and certain forms of molecular data). In the process, we clarify certain historical points of disagreement between proponents of the two methodologies, including a discussion of several forms of the ML optimality criterion. We also describe some additional results that shed light on how much needs to be assumed about underling models of sequence evolution in order to successfully reconstruct evolutionary trees.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the importance of molecular phylogenetics, few of its assumptions have been tested with real data. It is commonly assumed that nonparametric bootstrap values are an underestimate of the actual support, Bayesian posterior probabilities are an overestimate of the actual support, and among-gene phylogenetic conflict is low. We directly tested these assumptions by using a well-supported yeast reference tree. We found that bootstrap values were not significantly different from accuracy. Bayesian support values were, however, significant overestimates of accuracy but still had low false-positive error rates (0% to 2.8%) at the highest values (>99%). Although we found evidence for a branch-length bias contributing to conflict, there was little evidence for widespread, strongly supported among-gene conflict from bootstraps. The results demonstrate that caution is warranted concerning conclusions of conflict based on the assumption of underestimation for support values in real data.},

  Abstract                 = {Because recombination between a pair of viral genomes can occur only when both viruses are present in the same host, genealogical evidence of recombination is influenced by the rate of viral migration between infected hosts. If superinfection is rare, then recombining viral genomes will usually be more closely related to each other than to viral genomes present in other hosts and the impact of recombination on the genealogy of a sample of viruses from different hosts may be weak. We used this relationship to estimate the relative rate of intra-subtype HIV-1 superinfection in six urban populations. Comparisons of the population recombination rates estimated from the HIV-1 sequence data with population recombination rates estimated for sets of sequences simulated using a structured coalescent process suggest that intra-subtype superinfection rates in all but one of these populations may be as high as 15% of the corresponding infection rate. However, we caution that these estimates might be upwardly biased if variation in contact and mixing rates between infected hosts causes viral lineages to be concentrated in groups with higher than average superinfection rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Several Markov chain methods are available for sampling from a posterior distribution. Two important examples are the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis algorithm. In addition, several strategies are available for constructing hybrid algorithms. This paper outlines some of the basic methods and strategies and discusses some related theoretical and practical issues. On the theoretical side, results from the theory of general state space Markov chains can be used to obtain convergence rates, laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for estimates obtained from Markov chain methods. These theoretical results can be used to guide the construction of more efficient algorithms. For the practical use of Markov chain methods, standard simulation methodology provides several variance reduction techniques and also give guidance on the choice of sample size and allocation.},

  Abstract                 = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However, microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor: the 95% interval runs from ~15,000 to 130,000 years, with most likely values around 30,000 years.},

  Abstract                 = {PAML, currently in version 4, is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML). The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (dN and dS) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use. The package is written in ANSI C, and runs under Windows, Mac OSX, and UNIX systems. It is available at http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html.},

  Abstract                 = {We implement a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating species divergence times that uses heterogeneous data from multiple gene loci and accommodates multiple fossil calibration nodes. A birth-death process with species sampling is used to specify a prior for divergence times, which allows easy assessment of the effects of that prior on posterior time estimates. We propose a new approach for specifying calibration points on the phylogeny, which allows the use of arbitrary and flexible statistical distributions to describe uncertainties in fossil dates. In particular, we use soft bounds, so that the probability that the true divergence time is outside the bounds is small but nonzero. A strict molecular clock is assumed in the current implementation, although this assumption may be relaxed. We apply our new algorithm to two data sets concerning divergences of several primate species, to examine the effects of the substitution model and of the prior for divergence times on Bayesian time estimation. We also conduct computer simulation to examine the differences between soft and hard bounds. We demonstrate that divergence time estimation is intrinsically hampered by uncertainties in fossil calibrations, and the error in Bayesian time estimates will not go to zero with increased amounts of sequence data. Our analyses of both real and simulated data demonstrate potentially large differences between divergence time estimates obtained using soft versus hard bounds and a general superiority of soft bounds. Our main findings are as follows. (1) When the fossils are consistent with each other and with the molecular data, and the posterior time estimates are well within the prior bounds, soft and hard bounds produce similar results. (2) When the fossils are in conflict with each other or with the molecules, soft and hard bounds behave very differently; soft bounds allow sequence data to correct poor calibrations, while poor hard bounds are impossible to overcome by any amount of data. (3) Soft bounds eliminate the need for "safe" but unrealistically high upper bounds, which may bias posterior time estimates. (4) Soft bounds allow more reliable assessment of estimation errors, while hard bounds generate misleadingly high precisions when fossils and molecules are in conflict.},
