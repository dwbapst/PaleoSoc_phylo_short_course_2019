08:00 AM - Module 1 - Introduction: Tree-Thinking
	- Sandy C., Pete W.
	- 15 min, Lecture.
08:15 AM - Module 2 - Meet Our Data: Smith and Zamora, 2009
	- Davey W.
	- 10 min, Lecture.
	- Brief discussion about data set
	- Explaining what cinctans are and why echinoderms are cool
08:25 AM - Module 3 - Morphological Character Coding
	- Sandy C., Davey W., Pete W.
	- 30 min, Lecture & exercise
	- Mesquite exercise with S&Z 2009 data set.
	- Experiment - Examining character coding decisions
	- Possible consequences of different coding options
09:00 AM - Module 4 - Intro to RevBayes, Graphical Modeling
	- April W, ?
	- 45 min, Lecture & exercise
	- Plate notation?
09:45 AM - BREAK (15 min)	
10:00 AM - Module 5 - Tripartite Model 1: Morphological Character Change Models 
	- April W, ?
	- Lecture & Hands-On with RevBayes/RevNotebook.	
	- Likelihood concepts, Bayesian Methods, MCMC
	- Simple Mk, filtering
	- Teasers of how to relax some assumptions of the model:
		- transition rate symmetry?
		- across-site/char heterogeneity?
	- April: Learners first contact with RB; stuff will go wrong. Also a part where there is likely to be significant discussion, since no one really believes the Mk model. 
		- DWB: We've already seen this in comments in our registration survey. There will definitely be non-believers about Mk.
	- Push up right before lunch so people can yell at April afterwards
	- April: I think I'll have them work as a table: one person do an MCMC with the strict Mk model; others can each pick one thing to change. Maybe choose a different distribution for among-site rate variation, or allow asymmetrical transitions. They can compare results during/after lunch.
	- April: I'm going to turn my morph models talk in to an R Markdown document so that I can interweave activities with lecture.
	- April's materials from previous workshop: 		https://github.com/danlwarren/Evolution-2019-Phylogenetic-Methods-Workshop/tree/master/3%20-%20April%20Wright%20-%20Teaching%20and%20resesarch%20with%20RevBayes

01:30 PM - Module 6 - Tripartite Model 2: Clock Models for Character Change
	- April W.?, Davey W.?
	- 45 min, Hands-On with RevBayes/RevNotebook.
	- April: light, hands-on ... this is just sorta boring
	- Pete: tease looking at different rates across morph partitions?
02:00 PM - Module 7 - Tripartite Model 3: Fossilized Birth Death
	- Dave B., Davey W.?, Laura S.?
	- 1:30 min, Lecture & Hands-On with RevBayes/RevNotebook

		- Gavryushkina et al. 2014; 2016
	- Try to simplify, do not get lost in covering historical perspective
		- April: Simulate under a pure-birth process and ask whose data looks like this? Simulate under the FBD and show that this process allows sampled ancestors? 	
	- Unifies morph, clocks, tree priors
