This repository will serve as a place for developing and storing materials for the Revbayes-based short course in tip-dating phylogenetics. for GSA 2019, presented by The Paleontological Society.

This hands-on computational workshop is organized by Sandra Carlson and Peter Wagner, with instructors April Wright (), Laura Soul (@laurasoul), David "Davey" F. Wright (), and David Bapst (@dwbapst), instructional material assistance from Rachel Warnock,

 as well as teaching assistants (tentative list), William Gearty,
